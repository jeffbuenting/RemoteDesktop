### Master

Version: 1.0.3

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/tafpv0a5354i1x93/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jeffbuenting/remotedesktop/branch/master)

This is the branch containing the latest version.

### Description

So my initial thought for this, is that this would be a poor mans Remote Desktop Configuration manager.  If, for whatever reason, you are not allowed to install RDC, then this would be a solution for you. RIght now my thought process was to create an HTML page with the server names and then be able to click them to RDP to the server.  It has been brought to my attention that this may be a security issue by having a hyperlink run a script on the local computer.

Thus, I am shelving this for now.  Put I wanted a place holder out there so I can return to it with a better solution

Enjoy

Jeff
